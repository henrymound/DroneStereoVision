# Tello Image Stitching

## Directory Structure
- stitch_read: Contains all of the files related to stitching together images already taken and saved with the Tello.
- test_flights: Contains images of past test flights, with no specific application in mind.
- line_flights: Contains different subfolders, each of a different flight of the Tello strafing right for varying distances. The stitching results and subresults are also stored. 
### Programs
- radial_flights: Same as 'line_flights' but for panoramic images.
- upline: Same as 'radial_flights' and 'line_flights' but with Tello images of flights going straight up

## Programs
- picsinaline.py: 

# Things To Try
- When using scanning stitching the difference between the iamges in a line may not be significant enough. Perhaps flying up and down will yield better results
